Five major innovation platforms—AI,
Public Blockchains, Robotics, Energy
Storage, and Multiomics—are becoming
increasingly interdependent as
performance advances in one platform
unlock new capabilities in another.
Reusable Rockets sending Autonomous
Mobility AI chips to orbit could become
critical to scaling the Next Gen Cloud.
Multiomics data permissioned on Digital
Wallets could power Neural Networks
that catalyze the development of
Precision Therapies to cure rare diseases.

Disruptive technologies are intermeshing.
Convergence Network Strength, a measure
of the degree to which disruptive
technologies are catalyzing and being
catalyzed by each other, increased 35% in
2025.
AI remains the critical enabling innovation
platform, the importance of robotics as a
catalyst inflected in 2025.
Among major new developments: the
world's largest robots—reusable rockets—
could play an extraordinary role in enabling
AI; energy storage and distributed energy
systems have become critical enablers of
next gen cloud build-outs; and smart
contracts and stablecoins could support a
global digital monetary ecosystem, allowing
AI agents to coordinate and direct real-
world resources.
Note: Network strength measures the realized weighted strength of each network connection in relation to the maximum possible weighted strength in a fully connected network. Source: ARK Investment Management LLC,

Neural network demand for next gen cloud compute is running into earthly scaling constraints. Reusable rockets could come to the rescue. At a
competitive cost, space-based AI compute could provide the cloud with the computational power that neural networks need for continued growth.
AI chip growth could increase demand for reusable rockets 60x relative to our existing model.

Historically, technology paradigm shifts have
led to structural changes in GDP growth.
Capital investment alone, catalyzed by disruptive
innovation platforms, could add 1.9 percentage
points to annualized real GDP growth this decade.
The new capital base—robotaxis, next gen data
centers, and enterprise investments in AI agents—
should boost returns on invested capital. Realized
real growth could exceed consensus expectations
by more than 4 percentage points per year as other
innovations begin to impact the growth trajectory.
Each innovation platform—AI, Public Blockchains,
Robotics, Energy Storage, and Multiomics—should
provide a structural boost to global growth.

A disruptive technology requires a steep cost
decline crossing key price-points that open
compelling unit economics across multiple
sectors and serves as a platform for additional
technological innovation.
Quantum computing's performance
improvement curve has been slow. Despite
spending billions in research and development
(R&D), Google doubled qubits only once in more
than four years. Even if its performance and
costs were to improve markedly, achieving
Moore's Law's pace, quantum computing would
not be useful for cryptographic decryption until
the 2040s.

Artificial Intelligence
Computational systems and software that evolve with data
can solve intractable problems, automate knowledge work,
and accelerate technology's integration into every economic
sector. The adoption of Neural Networks should prove more
momentous than electrification and potentially create tens of
trillions of dollars of value. At scale, these systems will
require unprecedented computational resources, and AI-
specific compute hardware should dominate the Next Gen
Cloud data centers that train and operate AI models. The
potential for end-users is clear: a constellation of AI-driven
Intelligent Devices that permeate people's lives, changing the
way that they spend, work, and play. The adoption of artificial
intelligence should transform every sector, impact every
business, and catalyze every innovation platform.

ARK Big Ideas 2026: The Great Acceleration
Energy Storage
The declining costs of Advanced Battery Technology should
cause an explosion in form factors, enabling Autonomous
Mobility systems that collapse the cost of transportation.
Electric drivetrain cost declines should unlock micro-mobility
and aerial systems, including flying taxis, enabling business
models that transform cities. Autonomy should reduce the
cost of taxi, delivery, and surveillance by an order of
magnitude, enabling frictionless transport that will increase
the velocity of e-commerce and make individual car
ownership the exception rather than the rule. These
innovations combined with large-scale stationary batteries
and Distributed Energy Generation, notably solar and small-
scale fission, should address surging power demand from AI
data centers while substituting electricity for liquid fuel and
increasing system-wide resilience, reliability, and flexibility.

Multiomics
The cost to gather, sequence, and understand digital biological
data is falling precipitously. Multiomics Technologies provide
research scientists, therapeutic organizations, and health
platforms with unprecedented access to DNA, RNA, protein, and
digital health data. Cancer care should transform with pan-
cancer blood tests, and molecular diagnostics should begin to
identify and categorize a panoply of diseases. Fed by rich
multiomics data and powered by Programmable Biology, AI
systems running autonomous labs could collapse the cost of
drug discovery, development, and trials, transforming returns in
a sector that has stagnated. Biological discoveries should power
novel Precision Therapies that target and cure rare diseases and
chronic conditions, unlocking profound economics. Over time,
the design and synthesis of novel biological constructs will yield
advances in agriculture, material science, and even computation.

ARK Big Ideas 2026: The Great Acceleration
Public Blockchains
Upon large-scale adoption, all money and contracts
could migrate onto Public Blockchains that enable and
verify digital scarcity and proof of ownership. The
financial ecosystem is likely to reconfigure to
accommodate the rise of Cryptocurrencies—including
stablecoins that bridge traditional finance and
decentralized networks—and Smart Contracts. These
technologies should increase transparency, reduce the
influence of capital and regulatory controls, and
collapse the costs of contract execution. In such a
world, Digital Wallets will become increasingly
necessary as more assets become money-like and
corporations and consumers adapt to the new financial
infrastructure. As these wallets evolve into AI-driven
purchasing agents, they could become powerful
distribution platforms for digital services. Corporate
structures could be called into question.

ARK Big Ideas 2026: The Great Acceleration
Robotics
Catalyzed by artificial intelligence, Humanoid Robots should
operate alongside humans and navigate legacy infrastructure,
changing the way products are made and sold, and eventually
the way we live our lives. Specialized Robots—from industrial
arms to surgical and warehouse systems—should proliferate as
AI collapses the cost of integration, embedding automation into
every operational process across manufacturing, logistics,
healthcare, and the physical world. Meanwhile, Reusable Rockets
should continue to reduce the cost of launching satellite
constellations, enable uninterruptible connectivity and earth
observation, and open the frontier for space-based compute
infrastructure unconstrained by terrestrial power and cooling
limitations. A nascent innovation platform, robotics could
collapse the cost of transporting across distance with
hypersonic travel, the cost of manufacturing complexity with
specialized systems, and the cost of physical work with AI-
guided humanoid robots.
